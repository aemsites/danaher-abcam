The cells were then paraformaldehyde fixed and immunofluorescently labelled with anti-Ki67 (ab15580) at a dilution of 1/1000. The majority of the cells show little or no Ki67 staining, indicating they are in G0 arrest (red cells). Two cells however show strong nucleolar Ki67 staining indicating they are still cycling (green cells). The DNA is stained with DAPI and is shown in red. The Ki67 staining is shown in green. x 63 magnification.&lt;p&gt;Similar results were seen with an asynchronous population of HeLa cells. The Ki67 staining was localised to the periphery of the nucleoli and throughout the nucleoplasm of proliferating cells. (This data is not shown but is available upon request).&lt;/p&gt;</p>
